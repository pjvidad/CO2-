# Dashboard (In-Progress)

Instructions from Canvas:
Using Android Studios, revise the XML files of the activities you have created for the output for Lab Act 3.
Create your project Dashboard
Include all of the elements and assets that would appear in your dashboard.
You may use the elements board or code it inside of the activity_main.xml / layout file.
Update your Manifest File
Add any code in the MainActivity.java/kt that is needed by the manifest
file.
Your final output is the frontend of your Dashboard and Features of your project

### Next Steps

1.  Prioritize Layout
2.  To ask sir - if buttons should function (But since it's just dashboard, I think not)
